\section{CONCLUSION} \label{sec:future}
Advances in technology, deep learning, and computer vision have created new opportunities to understand and relate textual and rich content, but this also has resulted in a proliferation of tools and architectures that make systemization difficult. Content analysis encompasses diverse research fields, and one of the biggest challenges of the Memex project was finding and sharing derivative data generated by various teams working in various subdomains. We recongize this gowing challenge and continue to use Tika to unify content analysis frameworks like Tensorflow using fast, developer-friendly paradigms (e.g. REST APIs).  Memex demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of removing integration barriers to facilitate ``the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content of communication,'' as defined by content analysis pioneer, Bernard Berelson \cite{berelson1952content}.
