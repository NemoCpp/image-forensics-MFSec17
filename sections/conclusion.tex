\section{CONCLUSION} \label{sec:future}
The recent increase of content analysis technologies and architectures makes the systemization of such tools difficult. Content analysis encompasses diverse research fields, and sharing and integrating derivative data generated by various teams has been a significant challenge in the Memex project. The object recognition results discussed in section \ref{sec:evaluation} represent one of several deep learning applications developed as part of Memex. Serial number identification \cite{parekh2016tesseract}, image similarity \cite{zhou2016multimedia}, and video similiarity \cite{mattmann2016scalable} approaches have proven useful in various Memex domains but require significant development and coordination to integrate into core extraction pipelines. We recongize this as a broad problem and continue to use the Tika platform to unify content analysis frameworks like Tensorflow using fast, developer-friendly paradigms (e.g. REST APIs). Memex is a testament to the effectiveness and importance of removing integration barriers and extending content analysis capabilities - doing so will help law enforcement curb gun crises in the United States and abroad.
