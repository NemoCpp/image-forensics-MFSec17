\section{CONCLUSION} \label{sec:future}
% The recent increase of content analysis technologies and architectures makes the systemization of such tools difficult.
We have described our approach and motivation for automatically integrating image forensics into content analysis. Our motivations stem from a large corpus of 1.4 million weapons related images from the DARPA MEMEX effort, and our goals of automatically performing image classification to determine the illegal sale of automatic weapons, and other dangerous objects on the web. We integrated the widely used Google Tensorflow toolkit, and its ImageNet/Inception v3 model with the Apache Tika framework for automated and efficient image classification and analysis. We qualitatively and quantitiatvely evaluated the feasibility of our integration and report on running the integration over the MEMEX weapons data. We also describe our process for integrating Tensorflow and Tika.
