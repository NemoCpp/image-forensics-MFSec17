\section{CONCLUSION} \label{sec:future}
Advances in technology, deep learning, and computer vision have resulted in a proliferation of platforms and architecture patterns that make the systemization of content analysis tools difficult. Content analysis encompasses diverse research fields, and one of the biggest challenges of the Memex project was finding and sharing derivative data generated by various teams working in various subdomains. We recongize this growing challenge and continue to use Tika to unify content analysis frameworks like Tensorflow using fast, developer-friendly paradigms (e.g. REST APIs).  Memex demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of removing integration barriers to facilitate ``the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content of communication,'' as defined by content analysis pioneer, Bernard Berelson \cite{berelson1952content}.
