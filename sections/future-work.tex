\section{FUTURE WORK} \label{sec:future}
The object recognition results discussed in section \ref{sec:evaluation} represents one of several deep learning applications developed as part of the Memex program. Serial number identification \cite{parekh2016tesseract}, image similarity \cite{zhou2016multimedia}, and video similiarity \cite{mattmann2016scalable} approaches have proven useful in various Memex domains including weapons, human trafficking, and counterfeit electronics. However, these applications have been developed independently by various Memex performers and require significant effort and coordination to integrate in crawling and extraction pipelines built upon foundational tools like Apache Nutch and Apache Tika. With the extension of Tika's capabilities into Tensorflow and deep learning frameworks, this integration becomes easier and we plan to incorporate the aforementioned approaches into Memex's core extraction pipeline going forward.
